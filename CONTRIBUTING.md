# How to contribute

If you are here, that means a lot to me and the community!
Thanks for the generous thought of contributing to the lilcache project.

## Development guide

1. Fork your clone by clicking on the fork button.
2. Clone the project:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/lilcache
```

3. Move into the project directory! [Should not have said something this trivial :facepalm:]
```
$ cd lilcache
```

4. Open the project in an editor / IDE of your choice.
5. Make whatever-the-heck-changes-you-want.
6. If you have done something or resolved a PR, go ahead and:

```
$ git add <CHANGED_FILES>

$ git commit -m "<MY AWESOME COMMIT THAT WOULD TAKE LILCACHE TO THE MOON>"

$ git push           # to your main branch of-course
```

7. And raise a PR!
8. Wooohooo!
